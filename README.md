# American Sign Language Gesture Detection System

## Description:
Welcome to our Sign Language Translator Web Application, a powerful tool designed to assist the people who are having hearing problems and are unable to speak to individuals in a two-way communication with others without wasting too much time and effort. 
Our application provides seamless conversion between Sign languages and Textual representations, including custom signs such as Space, Delete, and Nothing, catering to diverse communication needs.

## Key Features:

1. **Sign Language to Text Conversion:** Our application accurately interprets sign language gestures and converts them into corresponding textual representations. Users can input sign language gestures via webcam or pre-recorded videos.

2. **Custom Sign Recognition:** In addition to standard sign language gestures, our application recognizes custom signs, enabling users to convey a wide range of messages effectively. Custom signs such as Space, Delete, and Nothing are seamlessly integrated into the translation process.

3. **Text to Sign Language Conversion:** Users can input text and receive real-time interpretations in sign language. This feature enhances accessibility for individuals who may not understand sign language but need to communicate with sign language users.

4. **Speech to Text Conversion:** Our application supports speech input, allowing users to speak directly into the system. The speech is transcribed into text, which can then be translated into sign language or displayed as text, depending on the user's preference.

5. **User-Friendly Interface:** With an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, our application ensures a smooth user experience. Users can effortlessly switch between input modes and customize settings according to their preferences.

6. **Accessibility:** We prioritize accessibility in design, ensuring that our application is usable by individuals with different abilities. This includes compatibility with screen readers, keyboard navigation options, and adherence to accessibility standards.
